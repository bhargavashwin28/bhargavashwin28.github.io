    <h2>Personal Response Questions</h2>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned that there are lots of commands that I can use to navigate Tabby such as entering directories and creating new directories.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when I first saw the commands because I didn't memorize them at first.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by using less attempts for the Journal as we started from the J1002.txt to the HTML and finally to the Digital Journal</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that navigating through Tabby is completely different than normal Computer Commands and it isbeneficial to understand how to work through this new software.</p>
