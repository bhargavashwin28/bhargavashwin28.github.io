    <h2>Section 1:</h2>
    <h3>1.1: What is Git communicating to you? </h3>
    <p>What I put into emacs, which is the first command. It also puts details like the unique tag, the author tag, and the commit message.</p>
    <h3>1.2: What do you see that is common between this git log command and the previous git commit?</h3>
    <p>It showed the message I put into emacs which is the commit command.</p>
    <h3>1.3: Why do you think this is?</h3>
    <p>It is a log of my previous commands and the message was changed with a time and date.</p>

    
    <h2>Section 2:</h2>
    <h3>2.1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?</h3>
    <p>They are red in the git status which means that files exist. </p>
    <h3>2.2: Are they both displayed in the same section? If not, why not?</h3>
    <p>They are not because file2 is displayed in the untracked file</p>
 
    <h2>Section 3:</h2>
    <h3>3.1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status? </h3>
    <p>They are green now, and there is no error.</p>
    <h3>3.2: Compare and contrast the manner in which the two files are displayed.</h3>
    <p>File1 is displayed as modified and File2 is displayed as New File</p>

    <h3>5.1: What does Git tell you has changed?</h3>
    <p>Git doesn't tell me the changes since they have already been made.</p>

    <h2>Personal Response Questions</h2>
    
    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "Big Idea"</h2>
    <p>I learned how to execute basic Github commands and how Git can display and track my files. </p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter</h2>
    <p>I encountered challenges when I was performing the first few commands because it felt uncomfortable to perform commands that I didn't understand </p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved</h2>
    <p>It could be improved if was a visual demonstration of all the commands </p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: how has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>What I've learned has affected my thinking by showing me the new knowledge about file storage using a different platform than Tabby. </p>
