    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>1.1: Why is one of the symbols used for exclusive disjuction? </h3>
    <p>Because in exclusive disjunction the output can be true if both values are false and that symbol most likely means that.</p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>2.1: Why is the formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table related only to the number of inputs, and why is the formula 2^n? </h3>
    <p>Since there are multiplying contasts, it is helpful to line up the corresponding input and output values.</p>
   
    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned that there are more complicated number manioulation forms than binary.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when attempting to learn the order of operations as the letter confused me.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by more detailed explanations as they were very brief and complicated. </p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that I have a lot to learn in terms of the basics of Computer Science and this concept is very tough. </p>
